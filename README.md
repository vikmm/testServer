# testServer

-Utilized 'express' & 'jsonwebtoken' to create the server.

-All GET and POST commands are done using Postman

-The timed Bearer token is created in Postman (30s) 
-The timed token key is created when the POST call is made and the 'Authorization' is given in the header.

-Once the token is taken, the client information will populate and will give you a max time of 30 seconds 
before it times out.
